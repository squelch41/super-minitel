MiniPi Keyboard Driver
======================

This is a tiny driver written in Python using python-uinput
to emulate a driver from the French Minitel matrix keyboard.

This driver must be used with the MiniPi v3.1 adapter board,
and handles all the keys. It is recognized as a legacy driver
by the system.

(This beta version includes dirty hacks from Adafruit MCP230XX
library in order to increase performance).
