MiniPi Joystick Driver
======================

This is a tiny driver written in Python using python-uinput
to emulate a driver from the French Minitel matrix keyboard.

This driver must be used with the MiniPi v3.1 adapter board,
and is recognized as a joystick. This setup allows the best
performances in order to play smoothly games on the Super
Minitel.
