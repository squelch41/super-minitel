Super Minitel
=============

This repository contains all the required resources to create a Super Minitel
entertainment System based on a French (Old) Minitel.

You may need:

* a MINITEL 1 from RTIC (Minitel 9 written on the bottom label),
* a 3D printer in order to print holders and so on,
* an online service as OSHPark to order the PCBs,
* a soldering iron, solder, and some practice.
